# Armiarma. A distributed network monitoring tool

## Motivation
Distributed p2p networks are gaining popularity with the popularization of blockchain applications. On a case scenarion, where the critical message exchange complitely relies on the p2p network underneath, a deep and complete analysis on the real-time network status can directly prevent or spot vulnerabilities on the application protocol.

With this idea in mind, from Miga Labs, we want to provide a tool able to join, p2p networks (check the protocol compatibility list), share and adopt the using protocols, so that we can provide the datasets and the tools to study the new generation blockchain networks.   

## Who are we?
[Miga Labs](http://migalabs.es/) is a young department of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). Miga Labs is a group specialized in next-generation Blockchain technology, with a focus on Sharding and Proof-of-Stake protocols.

## Installation

Currently supported protocols:
    - Ethereum 2
        - Mainnet

## NOTES
Please, note that the tool is currently on a developing stage, any bugs reports or suggestions will be accepted.
